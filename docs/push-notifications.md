4.3 Open [NearIT](https://go.nearit.com), select your app and navigate to “**Settings> Push Settings**”. Upload your .p12 under the “**Setup iOS push notifications**” block. You will be prompted to enter the password you have chosen previously (chapter 4.2)

### 5) Get the device token

Then in your app code you need to ask for the token.

```swift
// Swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool
    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    // ...
}
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [application registerForRemoteNotifications];
    // ...
}
```

When you get the token in the app, just give it to the SDK.

```swift
// Swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    manager.setDeviceToken(token)
}
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    [manager setDeviceTokenWithData:token];
}
```
